Geohash Mapper Module
=====================

This project can be used to create a heatmap of geohash polygons as a GeoJSON collection file. Input GeoJSON point files that fall within a geohash polygon's extents are used to create these heatmaps. 
Input Points with a datestamp are supported and can be used to filter the heatmap count aggregation by providing a date range. Multiprocessing is leveraged to process multiple input files parallely improving overall processing time.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Sample data
Sample input and output datasets are provided to demonstrate this functionality. This is a good starting point to understand the modules and how to prepare your own input datasets. 

The sample includes:
1) Two input point files - _LACollisions2012.geojson_ and _LACollisions2013.geojson_
Credits - These datasets were derived from point features acquired from Los Angeles GeoHub Open Data. 
The source dataset is named 'Collisions 2009-2013 (SWITRS)' and can be found in the GeoHub Open Data platform here: http://geohub.lacity.org/ 
2) Output heatmap geohash polygon collection file - _geohash_density.geojson_

### Setup

1. Install Python 3.6+ 
Latest version of 3.6.x can be downloaded here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3610/

2. Install Pip

3. Install the required packages. Run the following command in your terminal: 
```
$ cd geohash_mapper
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the code

A. Modify paths, query date ranges, geojson date field and formats in **main.py**
- For example
  - Input geojson point files are in a folder called 'sample_data'
  - Output geohash heatmap file path is created with a file name 'geohash_density.geojson' in the 'sample_data' directory
  - Start of date range is "2012-01-20 UTC"
  - End of date range is "2013-10-20 UTC"
  - Input date field is "COLLISION_"
  - Input date format is "%Y-%m-%d" 
- These are set as follows:
```
input_geojson_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), r'sample_data')
output_geojson_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), r'sample_data', r'geohash_density.geojson')
START_DATE = "2012-01-20 UTC" 
END_DATE = "2013-10-20 UTC" 
INPUT_DATE_FIELD = "COLLISION_" 
INPUT_DATE_FORMAT = "%Y-%m-%d" 
```
B. Run main.py. 
This will kickstart the aggregration process from input point files and create an output geohash collection file.
```
$ python main.py
```

## Visualizing the output

- Quickest way to visualize the output is using HERE's GeoJSON web mapper that can be found here: http://geojson.tools/
- Copy paste the contents of the output geojson file to the 'Editor' or upload the GeoJSON file.
